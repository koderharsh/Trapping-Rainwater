# Trapping Rainwater

## Project Description

This project is used to solve trapping rainwater problem with visual representations made using SVG. I have used precalculation algo for solving this problem. The output and visual representation will keep on changing dynamically with our input. Key Technologies used are **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript** and **SVG**.

## How to use project

For adding number in an array type the number in the input field and press *add* button. For deleting any number press the *bin* icon in front of that number. For editing some number press *edit* icon in front of the number. Then that number will appear in the input field where we can change the number and press *Replace* button.
